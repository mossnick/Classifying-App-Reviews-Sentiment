# Classifying-App-Reviews-Sentiment
In this project, we introduce the basics of NLP and associated techniques for app review and sentiment classification. 
This project aims to give a brief overview of text preprocessing and building a binary classification model on processed data.
The major steps of natural language processing for sentiment analysis used in this notebook are tokenization, stopword and punctuation removal, stemming and count vectorization. They are applied to the app review text data of 1500 instances. 
Three different count vectorizers are tested to see which gives the best model prediction. Models and vectorizers are saved so they can be deployed later on unseen app reviews.
